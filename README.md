My Watch List
--------------------------
This application allows users to create a personal acount, login, and customize their own movie/tv show watch list. Users can add movies/ tv shows to three sections:

* What to Watch
* Where I left Off
* Finished

Furthermore, you can take notes the movies/ tv shows added. Movie information from the imdb api will also be displayed in a modal when a movie is clicked. 

Lastly, you can also apply all of the above to video games, which is a whole other section.
